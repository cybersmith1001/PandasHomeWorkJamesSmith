Here is my DataSet on Crime Stats that I downloaded from The Office of Official Statistics Web Site: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/policeforceareadatatables

I ejoyed working on it but stopped mid way through as I have gone too far down the rabbit hole to turn back.
The data I used needed vetted before I uploaded it to Python/Juypter. I did this partially then as I worked on the file I realised that it has a total at the top and mid totals (regions) in the middle.
This scewed my data and I only realised when I started to complie the norm of Drug Offences and Weapon Offences.

Overall I enjoyed the assignment but I do not have time (due to the short submission period) to revist the work and start a fresh.
